A package to re-write python scripts to emoji and run emojipython files & code.
This is so ridiculous, don't use it.


Converting python to Emoji:
========

Run convert_file.py with the command line args of python the file you want to convert.
The program outputs a.out.py as the tokens, and emoji_python.py as the converted script wth more emoji fun.

Converting from Emoji to Python:
=======

Running emoji_to_python.py with a emoji-python argument will output a pure Python file (unconverted.py). You can run this file, providing that the origional input was valid python.
